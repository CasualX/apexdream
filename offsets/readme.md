Apex Legends Offset Dumper
==========================

The `r5apex.exe` binary on disk is encrypted and must be dumped from memory first.

Simply run apexbot, if its offsets are not correct it'll dump the game for you instead. You'll find an `r5apex.bin` file in the current directory.

From there you can dump its offsets with `cargo run --release -- "r5apex.bin" ini > stdout.ini`. The script will analyze the dumped binary and extract its offsets. Use these offsets to update the cheat. You can get human readable output without offsets with `cargo run --release -- "r5apex.exe" human > stdout.md`.

Alternatively use the precompiled wasm version: <https://casualhacks.net/apexstuff/apexdumper.html>. Just drop the `r5apex.exe` on the file input and wait.
